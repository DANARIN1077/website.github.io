            <p>When you have a health problem, you always find the right treatment for your condition, but you do not know whether to choose medication or physical therapy. What are the different advantages and disadvantages of these two methods? Which method fits your problem?
1. Advantages and disadvantages of using drugs 
For many mental health problems, medication is the fastest way to get relief. It may take two to three weeks for the medication to reduce symptoms. However, it can take some trial and error to find the right medication for your condition. Medications also have some side effects. Prolonged use of drugs can cause stomach problems. In addition, your symptoms will return when the patient stops taking the medication. Because many mental health problems last a lifetime, those who choose a treatment plan may need to continue taking medication for the rest of their life.</p>
